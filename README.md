## 🔍 Overview

In this work, we propose **SCB-Nets**, a novel deep neural network framework designed to automatically extract Straw Checkerboard Barriers (SCBs) from high-resolution Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images. Our method leverages domain-specific polarimetric features and deep learning techniques to improve extraction accuracy in complex agricultural environments.
